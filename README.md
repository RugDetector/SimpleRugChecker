Simple Rug Checker is a lightweight tool to detect rug-pull risks in smart contracts and tokenomics.

# üõ° Rug Checker - Smart Contract Threat Scanner

Rug Checker is a lightweight Windows-based tool designed to scan and analyze smart contracts for potential rug-pull patterns, exit scams, and malicious behavior. With just one click, it identifies high-risk signs in tokenomics, contract permissions, and liquidity behavior.

## üß† How It Works (Windows Version)

Once you download and run the software on Windows:

1. **Smart Contract Input**  
   - You paste or upload the smart contract address (e.g., Ethereum/BSC chain/Solana).
   - The tool fetches and analyzes the verified contract code from explorers (like Etherscan).

2. **Static Code Analysis**  
   - Scans contract code for common rug-pull red flags:
     - Hidden mint functions
     - Owner privileges (e.g., disabling sell, draining funds)
     - Liquidity control access
     - Trading lock or delay mechanics

3. **Tokenomics Check**  
   - Evaluates token distribution, ownership percentage, and holder risk.
   - Detects suspicious transfers and whale wallets.

4. **Audit Report Generation**  
   - Generates a local HTML or TXT report summarizing potential risks.
   - Gives a confidence score (Safe / Medium Risk / High Risk).

5. **Optional: On-Chain Simulation**  
   - Simulates a few blocks of on-chain behavior (experimental).
